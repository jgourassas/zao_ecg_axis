This software is a homage to all pioneers of electrocardiography,
This piece of software Is useful to find the electrocardiography axis of QRS complex
from the Frontal leads
The ecg_axis was described by Dr Zao n 1952 and 1984
  


  

  HOW TO USE IT
   First  I recommend to Read - Study  the two articles of Zao. 
   You can find them in Docs dir  
  
  HOW TO USE IT QUICK START: 
        In order to use the circular reference system,
        one first looks at the tracing of the successive
        limb leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL and aVF, to deter-
        mine the polarity of a given deflection; i.e.,
        whether the QRS complex is positive, negative or
        equiphasic. Then, starting with the innermost circle 
        for lead I (the white semicircle being positive,
        blue negative, and b o u n d a r y lines being
        equiphasic) and progressing outwards to leads II,
        III, aVR, aVL and aVF, one proceeds to match
        the semicircles with the polarities of the QRS
        complex previously obtained from the tracing.

        For example, if its polarities in the successive
        limb leads are pos., pos., pos., neg., equiphasic,
        pos., then referring to the circular reference
        s y s t e m gives a direction of + 60. 




To compile you need:
==============================
OpenGl, Rust, FLTK, fltk-rs

For Debian do: 
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxext-dev libxft-dev 
libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxrender-dev libxfixes-dev libpango1.0-dev 
libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev

Then Run with 'cargo run' or 'cargo bundle' o 'cargo bundle --release'

I have tested on a Linux Intel Machine running Ubuntu and Debian
  And works perfectly well
